I've implemented a GraphQL layer with Apollo for the provided REST API endpoints.

**Why?:**
Creating a GraphQL layer on top of a REST API enables clients to request specific information in a single query, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. It also establishes a unified endpoint for backend aggregation, supports real-time updates, and provides a robust typing system, contributing to an improved overall developer experience and reducing costs for server.
